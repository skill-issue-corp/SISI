This is a fork from the primary repo for Trauma Station called Inky Station. To prevent people forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server this is the content pack for Trauma Station.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) as it contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs and is the base for your fork.

## Building

You probably know. If you don't, just run this in the terminal (on windows, right-click taskbar and select powershell). You'll need git and dotnet 10 sdk (google it).

```
git clone https://github.com/Inky-Station/Inky-Station
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet run --project Content.Server
```

And in another terminal, `dotnet run --project Content.Client`.
